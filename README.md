# react-native-appclip-sample

Sample of AppClip made with react-native.

AppClip is a new feature for iOS 14 introduced in WWDC 2020.

It allows user to experience small portion of app without actually installing the app.

Followed steps of this [amazing Medium post](https://medium.com/@nazrdogan/create-app-clips-for-ios-14-in-react-native-abfade233fea) to make AppClip screen with react native.

Tested AppClip Card locally following [this instruction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/testing_your_app_clip_s_launch_experience)
